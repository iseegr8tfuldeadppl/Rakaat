Raka'at is a revolutionary app for muslims around the world, this simple and compact app with 9280 lines of code under its belt contains three tools:

# A Raka'at counter tool
 It works seemlessly by detecting your sajadat using your phone's light sensor, all you have to do is place your phone down, allowing you to know which rak'a you're in at anytime, it reminds you at Tahia aswell
This Raka'at counter uses a very sophisticated algorithm made specifically for prayers, it only counts a sajda if it thinks it's a proper physical sajda, it also knows and predicts when you're going to do a sajda using general knowledge (you can't possiblity do more than 2 sajdat within 5 seconds)

# A Kibla compass
a seemless Kibla compass that just works

# A Prayer Times Police
-> yes as you read, using the Raka'at counter tool the app is able to track your prayers and is able to know whether you have prayed or not, when you use the detector in a certain prayer, it will add a green checkmark on it.

-> This Prayer Cop allows you to pray previously missed prayers in previous days/weeks/months/years you can finally repray ANY missed prayer without having to keep track all the time

-> This Cop reminds you throughout the day to pray prayers that you haven't already checked (it allows you to check it from the notification itself avoiding having to open the app to check it)

-> More sauce to the app is an ongoing notification that shows you prayertimes and the next Adan, it also has a widget with more functionalities for best user experience

-> This tool automatically mutes your phone's ringmode when prayertime is near/recent and it is adjustable so you can choose when it mutes your phone and when it does not (can be switched on and off)
